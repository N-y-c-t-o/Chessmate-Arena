<-- Welcome to our castle -->

This is our semester [V] AI project.But AI functions only have a few.When we play with ai ,engine is speaking like human like that.Not too Much!.

This is something you should know.When you run multiplayer game mode,you need to open new terminal and locate multiplayer_mode file and run the node.js
Here is steps:
Step 1: Open the new terminal.
Step 2: Type cd multiplayer_mode 
Step 3: Type node server.js 
If it show "Server is listening on port 3000" ,you can play multiplayer mode.
If two players are already connected to the server, a third one will be disconnected.


If you need some help or looking for advance ,you can find the source at "@SimpleCodingTutorials" from youtube and talk this man.He is sweet!
